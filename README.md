# Bookshop App

## Overview

There are two routes, books and cart. Books will display a list of books as cards and each card will have an **Add** button that would add it the cart.

The Cart route will display all the books in the cart and each cart item can be deleted by pressing the **remove** button.

## Data

For now, create a json file named *books.json* inside domain/books and read all the books from there and display it on the page.

We would add apis in the future.

## Typescript

Everything must be created in typescript. As practicing it will make you more comfortable with it.

## State management

The client state, in this case, the cart must be a globally accessible state. Try using the **Context API** provided by React or you could also install any library that does the same job.
