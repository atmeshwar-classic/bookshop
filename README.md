# Bookshop App

## How to proceed

Before starting, create a new branch by your name and Employee ID, for eg: **atmeshwar-1053**, and then write your code.
Make sure to make several small commits with a relatable message.

## Evaluation

When your are done, create a Pull Request onto the main branch.

## Overview

There are two routes, books and cart. Books will display a list of books as cards and each card will have an **Add** button that would add it the cart.

The Cart route will display all the books in the cart and each cart item can be deleted by pressing the **remove** button.

## Data

For now, create a json file named *books.ts* inside domain/books and read all the books from it inside the async thunk and display it on the page.

We would add apis in the future.

## Typescript

Everything must be created in typescript. As practicing it will make you more comfortable with it.

## State management

We will use **Redux Toolkit** to manage our state in the app.

## Wireframes
